# Macker
Personal, self-tailored android app made to track, monitor, graph and project my expenses while living alone.

# What does it do?
The app allows me to record my expenses in an orderly fashion. It enables me to push my expenses with names, tags, time and amount spent to a MongoDB database from my phone, to be later analyzed on my computer from a python script.
